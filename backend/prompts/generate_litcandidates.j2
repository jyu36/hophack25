You are a research assistant. Given the experiment node context below, propose up to {{ k }} high-quality, relevant papers.

Node context:
- Topic/Problem: {{ problem }}
- Description: {{ description }}
- Motivation: {{ motivation }}
- Expectations: {{ expectations }}
- Hypothesis: {{ hypothesis }}
- Parent Experiments: {{ parents }}
- Child Experiments: {{ children }}
- Methods/Keywords (with aliases): {{ methods_aliases }}
- Datasets/Metrics: {{ datasets_metrics }}

Relationship type to target: {{ relationship }}  # one of: similar | builds_on | prior | contrast | auto

Output STRICT MINIFIED JSON only:
{"papers":[
  {"title":"...", "doi":"...", "relationship":"similar|builds_on|prior|contrast", "why":"<=20 words"},
  {"title":"...", "doi":"...", "relationship":"similar|builds_on|prior|contrast", "why":"..."}
]}
Rules:
- Match the requested relationship when possible; if {{ relationship }} == "auto", pick the most relevant mix.
- Temporal constraints:
  - If relationship is "prior": choose foundational works that clearly precede typical recent advances; avoid very recent papers unless they are surveys consolidating past work.
  - If relationship is "builds_on": choose recent works that extend/improve known baselines; avoid obviously old foundational papers.
- Include only papers you are â‰¥70% confident about. Do NOT fabricate DOIs.
- If DOI is unknown, set "doi": null.
- No extra text outside JSON.
